abstract: "A concern among regulators during a merger or acquisition is
  potential price increases due to the increase in market power. However, there
  has been increased concern for the non-price effects of mergers, such as the
  effects on product variety. Prior works in the literature consider these
  effects, yet do not consider how they may compare. This paper bridges this gap
  by comparing the welfare effects of product variety changes would be in
  relation to the welfare effects of price in the context of the MillerCoors
  merger. The merger's clear product definition, decision to merge unrelated to
  product variety, well measured consumer surplus effects, evidence of price
  coordination and involvement of two large competitors with heterogeneous
  products make this an ideal setting to measure these effects. I first test if
  the merger had any effect on product variety directly, and find product
  variety fell for Miller and Coors, but increased compared to its competitors.
  I then use a random coefficient nested logit model and estimate demand for the
  MillerCoors merger in the post-merger period, expanding on work from Miller
  and Weinberg (2017). I test how much consumers value products that were added
  and dropped after the merger with two basic counterfactuals, and find consumer
  surplus declines by at most a percent when new products are dropped after the
  merger. This is 25% of the consumer welfare effects of coordinated pricing
  found in Miller and Weinberg (2017). "
