title: How Much Do Consumers Care About Discontinued and New Products? A Case
  Study of the MillerCoors Merger
abstract: A concern among regulators during a merger or acquisition is potential
  price increases due to the increase in market power. However, there has been
  increased concern for the non-price effects of mergers, such as the effects on
  product variety. Prior works in the literature consider these effects, yet do
  not consider how they may compare. This paper bridges this gap by estimating
  what product variety changes would need to occur to match the welfare effects
  of price changes in the context of the MillerCoors merger. The merger's clear
  product definition, decision to merge unrelated to product variety, large
  literature on price effects on welfare, implicit collusion on pricing and
  involvement of two large competitors with both similar and distinctive
  products make this an ideal setting to measure these effects. I use a random
  coefficient nested logit model and estimate demand for the MillerCoors merger
  prior to and after the merger. I first test the value of the products that
  were added and dropped after the merger with two basic counterfactuals, and
  find consumer surplus does not change much with new or discontinued products
  leaving the market. I next test which products would need to be discontinued
  in the post-period to match the consumer welfare losses described in the
  literature.
